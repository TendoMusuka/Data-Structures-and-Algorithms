//Details about testing the program:
Printed the results and compared to the expected results.
Used the test file.

Challenges & How We Overcame Them:
Finding a time that was convinient for us- Worked separately and then regrouped having done most of the work and we could easily spot differences. 
Personally it took time understanding the concept and feeding in the right arguments-Had to revisit my class notes.

Hours Spent:
+/- 6 hours
